# JS Design patterns into practice

> Factory pattern

The Factory pattern, also known as the Builder pattern, allows us to wrap object creation code in a simple function so that we don't need to manually instantiate new objects.

* Creational pattern
* Wrap a constructor to return instances of objects
* Commonly used in JavaScript
* Simple creation of complex objects
* Create large numbers of similar objects


**Summary**

* Consist of a collection of objects, a factory, and a client that requires instances of the object
* Client controls the process, but is decoupled from the actual construction
* Easy to extend with new types of objects
